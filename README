The default dimensions of the grid itself are currently 5x5.
The main interest of this project at the moment is the thread queue that can take any kind of object. It started with me just wanted to play with threads.
I just ended up created an ADT-like object called the Cortex, which takes specialized_cortex_objects<> that inherit properties from a generic cortex_object class.

Fun and games start there. Things are still in progress.
This project is more for the sake of learning than it is for any practical application (although I might use my cortex for other projects?). Maybe other ideas will arise during its development.

Find any bugs? SEGFAULTs? Suggestions? Email me at heilong24@gmail.com
